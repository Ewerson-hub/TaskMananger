> This is one of my first Project with Javascript maked in 2022 when I started my study for web developing !
The promisse it was to create one task mananger only using front-web tools (at the time I didn't know how to develop server-side with javascript).
I ended up finding this lost project on a pen drive and I thought it would be interesting to expose it here.
